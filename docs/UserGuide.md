the feature section. Let's try to familiarize ourselves with the basic components and formats to execute a command.
> **Tip:** All the command words are case-sensitive!
>
> * `add` is different from `Add`

#### 3.3.1 Parameter Prefixes:

In InnSync, a parameter prefix acts as a delimiter for specifying different types of parameters in commands.
Here's a reference table for all parameter prefixes and their corresponding parameters:

| Parameter Prefix | Corresponding Parameter  |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| `n/`             | `NAME`                   |
| `p/`             | `PHONE`                  |
| `e/`             | `EMAIL`                  |
| `a/`             | `ADDRESS`                |
| `b/`             | `BOOKING_TAG`            |
| `bp/`            | `BOOKING_PROPERTY`       |
| `bd/`            | `BOOKING_DATE`           |

#### 3.3.2 Parameters:

In InnSync, a parameter represents a placeholder where users input data.
Parameters typically follow immediately after their corresponding Parameter Prefixes.
Essentially, they are to be supplied by the user.

**Note:** All user inputs, including parameters, will be trimmed (all leading and trailing whitespaces will be ignored).

| Parameter          | Prefix   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

However, names containing prefixes, such as ```murthu a/p vara``` must be preceded by a ```$``` to avoid the prefix being interpreted as one.<li> **For example:**<ul><li>```n/Muthu a/p vara``` → Name: Muthu, Address: p vara <li>```n/Muthu $a/p vara``` → Name: Muthu a/p vara (entire string is parsed as the name, and ```$a/p``` is ignored as a prefix) <li>The ```$``` is used to prevent the parser from treating the following string as a prefix — it tells the parser "don't treat this as a field, treat it as part of the value."</ul><li>You are unable to add names containing ```$```, as it is used for the purpose mentioned above.

#### 3.3.3 Command Format:

To understand how a full command is interpreted, we will utilise the following example.

**Example:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG...] [b/BOOKING_TAG...] [r/REQUEST...]`
>**Tip:** You can add a visitor without specifying a tag, booking tag and request and that is why it has a bracket around it!

**Structure of Command:**<br>

|         | Component        | Description                                            |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `add`   | Command          | Executes Add Command to add a visitor.                 |
| `n/`    | Parameter Prefix | Unique prefix to distinguish `NAME` from other prefix. |
| `NAME`  | Parameter        | Represents placeholder for name of the visitor.        |

**General Notes about InnSync:**<br>

> **A command can be categorized into three formats:**
> 1. `COMMAND` + `INDEX`
> 2. `COMMAND` + `PARAMETER_PREFIX` + `PARAMETER`
> 3. `COMMAND` + `INDEX` + `PARAMETER_PREFIX` + `PARAMETER`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
e.g. `[t/TAG...]` can be used as ` `&nbsp;(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## 4.2 Features related to visitor

### 4.2.1 Adding a visitor: `add`

Adds a visitor to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG...] [b/BOOKING_TAG...] [r/REQUEST...] [m/MEMO]`

<box type="Tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A visitor can have any number of tags or requests (including 0) and at most one memo.

**Tip:** If a visitor's name contains a prefix e.g. ```/```, escape the prefix with ```$```.
e.g. To add a visitor with the name "murthu a/p", use the command `add n/murthu $a/p [...]`.
</box>

**Note:** New visitors added will be sorted lexicographically among the ones without stars.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/+65 98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/+65 1234567 t/criminal t/offence r/cool r/beans m/handsome`

### 4.2.2 Editing a visitor : `edit`

Edits an existing visitor in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BOOKING_TAG...]​ [t/TAG...]​ [r/REQUEST...] [m/MEMO]`

* Edits the visitor specified by `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed visitor list. The index **must be a positive integer**.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the visitor will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the visitor’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* You can remove all the visitor’s booking tags by typing `b/` without specifying any tags after it.
* You can remove all the visitor’s requests by typing `r/` without specifying any booking tags after it.
* You can remove the visitor’s memo by typing `m/` without specifying any memo after it.

<box type="Tip" seamless>

**Tip:** To edit a visitor's name to contain a prefix, escape the prefix with ```$```.
e.g. To change the name of the first contact in the list to "murthu a/p", use the command `edit 1 n/murthu $a/p [...]`.

</box>

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/+65 91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st visitor to be `+65 91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd visitor to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower b/` Edits the name of the 2nd visitor to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing booking tags.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower r/` Edits the name of the 2nd visitor to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing requests.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower m/` Edits the name of the 2nd visitor to be `Betsy Crower` and clears memo.

### 4.2.3 Listing all visitors : `list`

Shows a list of all visitors in the address book.

Format: `list`

**Note:** Any additional text or parameters after the `list` command will be ignored.

which does not exist as ```$``` is not allowed in names but you can still do it.
**[Planned Enhancement]** There are ongoing plans to allow the use of ```$``` to escape any prefixes,
to enable you to search for names containing prefixes, i.e. find a contact whose name contains "murthu a/p" - `find n/murthu $a/p`.

**Searching by phone:**
* `find p/9123` - Finds contacts whose phone numbers contain "9123"

## 6. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
